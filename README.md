---->>Objective

To analyze revenue trends, cancellation rates, and operational performance using transactional ecommerce data and generate business insights through an interactive Power BI dashboard.

--->>Tool Used

• Power BI (Data cleaning, modeling, DAX, visualization)

-->>Dataset Source

Dataset sourced from Maven Analytics.
The dataset consists of multiple related tables used for analysis:
• Orders
• Customers
• Products
• Additional supporting tables for metrics and performance tracking
These tables were connected using relationships in Power BI for integrated analysis.

--->>Process Followed

1. Data understanding and exploration
2. Data cleaning and transformation in Power BI
3. Building relationships between multiple tables (Customers, Orders, Products)
4. KPI identification
5. Dashboard design and visualization
6. Insight generation using trends and comparisons

-->>Dashboard Highlights

KPI Metrics
• Total Revenue
• Average Order Value (AOV)
• Cancellation Rate
• Lost Revenue
• Total Orders

-->>Analysis Performed

• Revenue by product
• Revenue by category
• Revenue by state
• Time-based revenue trend
• Top performing states analysis
• Monthly cancellation trend

-->>Key Insights

• Revenue decline is associated with a decrease in order volume.
• High pre-dispatch cancellations are contributing to revenue loss.
• Performance dropped significantly during certain months.
• Revenue is concentrated in a few key states.
• A clear performance gap exists between top and low-performing states.

-->>Limitations

• Shipping cost data was not available in the dataset.

-->>Recommendations

• Investigate reasons for high cancellations before dispatch.
• Analyze operational issues affecting performance during low-revenue months.
• Focus on improving performance in low-performing states.
• Monitor category-wise demand to optimize revenue contribution.

-->>Files Included

• Power BI dashboard file (.pbix)
• Orders dataset
• Customers dataset
• Products dataset
• Dashboard screenshots

-->>Outcome

This project demonstrates practical use of Power BI to analyze operational e-commerce data,build relationships across multiple tables, and generate actionable insights for data-driven
decision-making.
